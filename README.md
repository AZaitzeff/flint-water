## Progress Report
Here is the data we have
1. Residential testing data 
    a. Volunteer tests
    b. For each test
      i. Lead and copper levels in "parts per billion"
        1. 15 ppb is the EPA action level
        2. Not known what is the "safe level"
      ii. Time of test
      iii. Address
2. Parcel data
  a. Every piece of land in flint has a parcel id
  b. Address
  c. Year built
  d. Lots more data
3. Sentinel data
  a. 400ish sentinel sites
  b. Originally we didn't have full addresses
  c. We bugged the DEQ (department of environmental quality), and got parcel IDs for every sentinel site
  d. We also got no. of dogs in the house, and an absurd amount of other data bout these houses
4. Service line data
  a. There was non-digital data out there from decades ago
  b. Was digitized by folks at UM-Flint or possibly folks in SI here involved

## Brainstorm of questions to answer
1. Is the sentinel data reliable??! How does it relate to the residential data? Repeated testing in residential data matches the sentinel repeated testing?
2.
